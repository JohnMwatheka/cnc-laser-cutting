          <h2>CNC Plasma Cutting</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Our CNC Plasma cutter uses thermal cutting to melt the metal instead of mechanically cutting it, with limitation to electrically conductive material only. It offers a comparatively cheaper means of cutting medium-thickness cuts with high precision, repeatability, and cutting speed. Our machine can cut metals as thick as 8mm, with consideration of the size of the cut profile and application of the parts. CNC plasma cutting can be applied in the cutting of

            <h2>Oxy-gas Cut CNC</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              Oxy-gas Cut CNC is a combustion process using oxygen/fuel gas flame. The heating flame brings the material up to its ignition temperature. Then a jet of Oxygen at least 99,5 % pure is blown onto the heated spot. The Oxygen jet oxidizes the metal. The torch is moved and a narrow cutting kerf is created, removing the slag from the kerf. The quality of the cut depends on the surface condition of the material, cut-velocity and thickness.

          <h2>Shearing and Bending</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Shearing is defined as the mechanical cutting of large sheets of metal into smaller pieces of predetermined sizes. A shearing operation that completes an entire perimeter is known as blanking, with the resulting workpiece being called a blank. Bending is defined as the creation of three-dimensional shapes out of two-dimensional stock. There is virtually an unlimited variety of shapes that can be produced in both sheet metal and plate thickness’ by bending.

          <h2>Wire-Cut EDM CNC</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Also known as wire-cut Electric Discharge Machine (EDM) for the purpose of making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. It is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods.

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Water Jet CNC</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Water Jet Cutter CNC is an industrial tool capable of cutting a wide variety of materials using a very high-pressure jet of water, or a mixture of water and an abrasive substance, in this case granite. An important benefit of the water jet is the ability to cut material without interfering with its inherent structure, as there is no heat-affected zone (HAZ). Minimizing the effects of heat allows metals to be cut without harming or changing intrinsic properties. Sharp corners, bevels, pierce holes, and shapes with minimal inner radii are all possible.

          <h2>Who does CNC Laser Cutting cater for?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>CNC Laser Cutting</b> cater for all trades from hotels and lodges to beach resorts and private villas to homes. Each with their own individual custom laser cutting requirements: architectural trade, camera departments, exhibition designers, event organizers, graphic designers, jewelers and fashion trade, model makers, production designers in film and TV, prop makers, prototyping, retail window display companies, wedding organizers and many more.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>How does Laser Cutting Work?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Our Laser cutting machine works by firing a high power Co2 laser that cuts by melting, burning or vaporizing the material. An extremely fine level of cutting detail can be achieved with a wide variety of materials and with various textiles such as acrylic, foam, leather, wood and more. We can replicate company logos and artworks into cutting or engraving formats. Laser cutting systems can manufacture components directly from CAD drawings faster than any other process. The laser cutter is very flexible and works from numerous file formats such as AI, EPS and PDF.

          <h2>Laser Cutting Capabilities</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Our high-speed laser cutting machine is fitted with a 100-watt tube, which allows us to cut soft and hard materials to the highest quality and precision. It can cut through most materials achieving infinitely complex cuts and engravings. The applications of laser cutting technology are endless.

          <h2>Other features of CNC Laser Cutting </h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Our new laser cutting machine is a Universal Laser system which has an impressive workable bed size and. Our Universal Laser is a super-speed system, of which there is only a handful in the Kenya. It uses laser beams which enables it to carry out any engraving task in half the normal time. A unique feature of our laser cutting systems is the ability to control the power of the laser by speed and temperature. This allows us to score and etch onto the surface for detailed work to a correct depth of cut.

            <h2>What is CNC Laser Cutting </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              Laser cutting is a versatile non-contact process to accurately cut a diverse range of materials using an intense beam of light. It has a huge advantage over more traditional methods because of its speed, accuracy and precision. The laser cutting method gives the option to switch quickly between multiple applications and set-ups, saving time and the need to run multiple machines.<br><br>The three main types of laser cutting are CO2, YAG and Fiber. Our series of laser cutting machines all uses the CO2 method, which is ideally suited for cutting and engraving plastics, card, wood, leather and fabrics. Our five machines vary in size giving us the capability of engraving and cutting thick materials over large surface areas to intricate detailing work over very small areas. Through years of working and experimenting with different materials, our London laser cutting technicians have come to truly understand these state-of-the-art machines and how each one has its own strengths. By working across so many different industries there is a natural cross-pollination of ideas, skills and to a certain extent trade secrets. This acquired knowledge gives our highly trained laser cutting operators the ability to offer specialist consultation. The combinations are endless, which is where our knowledge and expertise comes in. We can recommend which laser cutting machine to use depending on your project needs. As laser cutting experts, we will work closely with you considering your project and advising on how to achieve the best possible results, however bespoke or challenging.
